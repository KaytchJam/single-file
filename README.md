Repository for single-file snippets of code. Mostly for testing, but sometimes I like to revisit them.

Span across different languages. Here's how to run and/or compile the files in each language.

```C++
// C++ (GCC Compiler)
g++ <file_name> -o <executable_name>
```

```Rust
// Rust
rustc <file_name>
```

```Python
# Python
python -m <file_name>
```
